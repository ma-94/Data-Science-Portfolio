# End to End Data Science Project: MKBHD Youtube Channel EDA

This project involves analysing and answering questions pertaining to Marquez Brownlee's Youtube channel with the aid of Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Youtube API. The data fetched via API contains video title, description, view/like/comment count, duration, published date, etc.

## Aims & Objectives 

Marques Brownlee is a popular technology-focused Youtuber whom I have followed for quite some time due to his concise, insightful & relevent reviews: Marquez's channel, MKBHD, has over 16 million subscribers. The aims & objectives of this exploratory data analysis are as follows:
- Getting to know Youtube API and how to obtain video data.
- Does the number of likes and comments matter for a video to get more views?
- Does title length matter for views?
- Does the video duration matter for views and interaction (likes/ comments)?
- How many tags do videos with high view count have?
- How often does Marques upload videos?
