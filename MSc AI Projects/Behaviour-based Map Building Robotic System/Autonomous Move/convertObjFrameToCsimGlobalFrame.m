% function to convert sensor points from the sensor's co-ordinate frame to
% CoppeliaSim global reference frame
% INPUT: Row Matrix of X, Y, Z matrices, Euler Angles of Sensor Frame,
% Origin (translation shift) of sensor frame with respect to CoppeliaSim
% global reference frame
function globalShifted = convertObjFrameToCsimGlobalFrame(...
    cartX, cartY, cartZ, eulerAngles, translation)
    % Build a rotation matrix since laser axes have relative pose /
    % orientation with respect to global origin frame. Also,
    % remember that all point cloud coordinates are relative to
    % laser frame
    % Convert Euler Angles to Rotation Matrix
    % The Euler angles are specified in the axis rotation sequence. 
    % The default order for Euler angle rotations is "ZYX".

    % CoppeliaSim also follows the same order for Euler Angles

    rotationMatrix = eul2rotm([0,0,eulerAngles(1)]) * ...
        eul2rotm([0,eulerAngles(2),0]) * ...
        eul2rotm([eulerAngles(3),0,0]);

    % Note for above: Out of the 3 euler angles, Rz(Î³) - also known as Yaw
    % angle - is the most significant one. This is angle which signifies
    % rotation about Z axis (aka, rotation in the XY plane). We know from
    % the robot movement in CoppeliaSim that all motion happens in XY plane
    % only. Hence, euler angle values for Rx and Ry for laser
    % reference frame rotation would be 0 or near 0.
    % 
    % However, for the sake of completeness and generality, we have kept
    % the rot_mat (rotation matrix) as a product of all 3 rotations (Rx, Ry
    % and Rz)

    % We want to inverse the XYZ points rotation, so we multiply the
    % current XYZ points with the inverse of the matrix
    % A / B is faster syntax for A * inv(B)
    % cartX' is transpose of cart
    globalRotated = [cartX', cartY', cartZ'] / rotationMatrix;
    % globalRotated' is transpose of globalRotated
    globalRotated = globalRotated';
