# üë®‚Äçüíª Projects

Here's a brief high-level overview of the main projects completed in the last 1.5 years (2021-22):

- Development of a generative chatbot utlising Seq-2-seq algorithms owing to their sequential learning and predictive properties; two seq-2-seq models with and without an attention layer are constructed and WikiQA dataset selected for experiments. Future work might include dropout layer integration to tackle overfitting and experimentation with token dropout to enhance data augmentation.
- Almedius is a software which solves Sudoku with the aid of genetic algorithms; in terms of comparative performance of selection strategies, roulette outperforms tournament, which in turn outperforms ranked. Future work might involve implementation of dynamic adaptation of the mutation rate and avoiding unnecessary competition by opting for a single population with a higher amount of chromosomes. 
- Development of convolutional neural network (CNN) models for pneumonia detection; SqueezeNet with an f1-score of 0.81 outperforms VGG16, DenseNet and Autokeras models; Future work might involve developing an end-to-end system for pneumonia identification with the aid of deep learning detection, segmentation and classification. Furthermore, models capable of detecting a patient's genetic predisposition to develop pneumonia should be explored with the help of relevent datasets (blood tests, sensor readings, etc).
- Development of a 2D occupancy grid map for an enviornment containing obstacles using both inverse sensor model and wandering behaviour; in terms of performance, wandering beahviour (autonomous move) covered more area in less time compared to teleoperation. Future work might involve implementing potential field, vector field histogram algorithms along with bubble band techniques to carry out comparative analysis of time taken for map generation and avoidance effiency of respective algorithms.
